# nasaSpaceApps2023_Space_Tourism

Nasa Space Apps 2023 - Planetary Tourism Office. This app is a python django app for the 2023 Nasa Space Apps Challenge. The Challenge is the Planetary Tourism Office Challenge as stated below:

"In the distant future, space tourism will likely be routine for Earth dwellers, but space travelers will need help choosing a destination and determining an itinerary. Imagine you are a travel agent at a future space tourism office. Your challenge is to create a tool that will not only develop customized itineraries for future travelers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system—perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn—but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system."

This app will utilize a few pages that will reference how tourism to Jupiter and its major moons could entice future humans. The main page will have a 3d-model of Jupiter and some fun facts behind Jupiter and why it would be such a fun location to visit. There will then be links below that will take you to a new page for a few of the major moons of Jupiter. I will also add a tab to have a "sign" in option were potential "customers" could pick and choose their visit to Jupiter and its local moons.

Special Thanks to Sarah - team member; for providing informational on Jupiter, moons, and photos.
